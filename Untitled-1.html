<P>
    There are people whom you can’t replace,
    They’re the ones who gave you your face.
    They’ll love you through thick and thin,
    They show you the light from deep within.
    And if by chance you happen to die,
    They’ll be the ones who will really cry.
    
    You see, my friend, there’s no one who can love you more
    Than your very own parents, that’s for sure.
    Always remember this is true,
    That wherever you go, your parents will be there for you.”
</P>
